# Easy_Web_Crawler_lolskins
An easy web crawler which you can get all champions' skins from the official website https://lol.qq.com/main.shtml
  

inspired by a CSDN blog https://blog.csdn.net/qq_42453117/article/details/109961751?ops_request_misc=%257B%2522request%255Fid%2522%253A%2522160673424119215668890813%2522%252C%2522scm%2522%253A%252220140713.130102334.pc%255Fall.%2522%257D&request_id=160673424119215668890813&biz_id=0&utm_medium=distribute.pc_search_result.none-task-blog-2~all~first_rank_v2~rank_v28-4-109961751.pc_search_result_cache&utm_term=30%E8%A1%8C%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E8%8B%B1%E9%9B%84%E8%81%94%E7%9B%9F&spm=1018.2118.3001.4449


Noticed that you should changed the path to your destination folder in order to let it run correctedly.

project builds on jupyter notebook in Python 3.0 language, with few library imported. 
Friendly for beginner who is new to web_crawler

The ideal outcome should be looked like those screenshots I uploaded as attachments(using macbook os system)
